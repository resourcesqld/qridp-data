This includes completing the transition to Progressive Rehabilitation and Closure Plans for approximately 200 mine sites.One of the final actions in the financial assurance and mine rehabilitation program addressed residual risk, with reforms commenced on 20 August 2020. These reforms give industry more clarity and certainty about the surrender of resources sites. Another reform was establishment of a Queensland Mine Rehabilitation Commissioner, who will commission research, publish best practice advice and report more publicly on progressive rehabilitation outcomes. Moving forward, the government will continue to engage with industry and the community to identify opportunities for collaboration and innovation when it comes to post mining land uses.

In response to stakeholder feedback, the Government will revise the land access principles and integrate them into the Land Access Code.  The Land Access Code is a best practice guideline for communication and negotiation between resource companies and landholders and applies to most resource authority types in Queensland.  As the relevant resource company must provide a copy of the Land Access Code to landholders with an initial entry notice and negotiation notice, this will ensure that both parties are aware of government?s expectations.

,48,Improve cost recovery for government services provided to industry and review rent settings to ensure tenures are actively explored and developed ,"The implementation of a package of process and regulatory reforms will improve the efficiency of the services and functions that the government provides to the resources industry. The Department of Resources currently recovers only around 15 per cent of the total cost of administering the regulatory framework that applies to the resources industry.  Consistent with the government?s Principles for Fees and Charges, it is appropriate that the fees and charges paid by the resources industry be reviewed to ensure they better reflect the costs of services being provided.
